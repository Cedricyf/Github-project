    "Tom wants to start a coffee shop in Toronto. But he is a beginner in this area and he does not want to open the coffee at a neighborhood where there are many coffee shops and very competitive. However, if he open the coffee shop at a neighbhood where there is no coffee shop, such neighborhood may be lack of residents and tourists which can be a problem for the revenue.Therefore, he wants to open his coffee shop at the neighborhood which has the number of coffee shop closest to the mean number of coffee shop in all neighborhood of Toronto. Moreover, Tom is not very confident with the taste of his coffee, therefore, he prefer the neighborhood with average coffee shop rating less than 8/10"
